Instructions for use

This was originally developerd on Slackware circa 13.1, however that Slack version does not boot on VirtualBox 6.0.12.
Use instead Slackware 13.37.  Slackware 14.0 is too late and some compile errors start to emerge at that point 
(probably fixable but...).  You will need to download kernel linux-2.6.37.6.tar.bz2 and put it in the openwrt/dl directory 
because the OpenWrt have removed it from their site.  Otherwise the compile seems to work as of 12 Oct 2019.

To build Bifferboard firmware and emulator type 'make'.

To run the image under the emulator type 'make run'.
CTRL-A, X quits the emulator.

Edit the Makefile to suit how you want to organise your virtual
network.  See Qemu documentation at http://qemu.weilnetz.de/qemu-doc.html
